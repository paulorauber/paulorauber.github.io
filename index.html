    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I am a lecturer in Artificial Intelligence at Queen Mary University of London. Before becoming a lecturer, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Swiss AI lab working on reinforcement learning under the supervision of <a href="https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jürgen Schmidhuber</a>.</p>
    <p>I believe that intelligence should be defined as a measure of the ability of an agent to achieve goals in a wide range of environments <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0712.3329" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Legg and Hutter, 2007)</a>, which makes reinforcement learning an excellent framework to study many challenges that intelligent agents are bound to face.</p>
    <p>I am currently interested in unlocking the potential of formalization to accelerate the development of machine learning theory.</p>

    <p> Formalization is the process of translating mathematical statements and their proofs into a formal language that enables their correctness to be verified algorithmically. The mathematical community has largely adopted the open-source programming language <a href="https://lean-lang.org/">Lean</a> for formalization, whose <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/index.html">mathematical library</a> has more than a million lines of code. Several organizations are also developing trustworthy problem solvers that combine general-purpose large language models with Lean. As these systems improve and become more widely available, they may support the development of provably safe artificial intelligence.</p>
