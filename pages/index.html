<p>In the context of machine learning, I am interested in the development of principled methods to allow agents to learn state representations for partially observable environments. These representations should be learned from trial and error, and should be suitable for making <i>good</i> decisions.</p>

<p>Among other things, I am currently interested in applying recurrent neural networks (<i>e.g.</i>, long short-term memory networks) as function approximators in reinforcement learning.</p>

<p>I believe computer games are the ideal testbed for reinforcement learning, since they often contain challenging and well defined tasks. Success on games should be followed by success in restricted real world environments, as long as state representations encode past events based solely on raw observations, reward signals, and no ad-hoc knowledge. Success in real world environments, however, would still require a wide variety of skills, <i>such as writing an academic webpage</i>.</p>

<p>My previous work has been mostly on the intersection between image analysis, machine learning, and information visualization.</p>

<p>My curriculum vitae is available <a href="docs/cv.pdf">here</a>, and some of my work is available <a href="work.html">here</a>.</p>
