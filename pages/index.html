<h3>About</h3>

<p> Paulo Rauber is a lecturer in artificial intelligence at Queen Mary University of London. He holds a joint PhD degree in computer science from the University of Campinas and the University of Groningen, which he obtained for his work on the intersection between machine learning, image analysis, and information visualization. Before becoming a lecturer, he was a postdoctoral researcher in reinforcement learning at the Swiss AI Lab under the supervision of JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber. </p>

<p> Paulo is particularly interested in studying four major challenges that must be addressed efficiently by reinforcement learning agents: building models that enable reliable planning; exploring environments systematically; learning state representations; and generalizing desirable behavior. </p>
