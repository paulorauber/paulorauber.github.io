<p>I am particularly interested in studying four major challenges faced by reinforcement learning agents:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Learning state representations that enable good decisions in partially observable environments;</li>
  <li>Building an environment model that allows evaluating the consequences of action sequences; </li>
  <li>Exploring alternative ways to achieve goals considering environment model uncertainty; </li>
  <li>Generalizing experience across environments and bootstrapping from a curriculum. </li>
</ul>

<p>My earlier work was mostly on the intersection between image analysis, machine learning, and information visualization.</p>

<p>My curriculum vitae is available <a href="docs/cv.pdf">here</a>, and some of my work is available <a href="work.html">here</a>.</p>
