<h3>About</h3>

<p>I am particularly interested in studying four major challenges faced by reinforcement learning agents:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Learning state representations for partially observable environments;</li>
  <li>Building environment models that enable planning; </li>
  <li>Exploring alternative ways to achieve goals; </li>
  <li>Generalizing knowledge across environments. </li>
</ul>

<p>Before focusing on reinforcement learning, I worked on the intersection between machine learning, image analysis, and information visualization. </p>
