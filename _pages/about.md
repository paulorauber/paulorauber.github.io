I am a lecturer in Artificial Intelligence at Queen Mary University of London. Before becoming a lecturer, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Swiss AI lab working on reinforcement learning under the supervision of JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber.

I am particularly interested in studying three major challenges that must be addressed efficiently by reinforcement learning agents: learning state representations under partial observability; exploring systematically; and planning under uncertainty.
